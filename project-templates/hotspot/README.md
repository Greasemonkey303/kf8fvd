# Hotspot Project Templates

Place files related to the Hotspot project here. This folder is intended to hold example configuration files, templates, or small assets you want to keep with the repo.

Recommended filenames and usage:

- `mmdvm.ini.example` — example MMDVMHost configuration (rename when deploying)
- `pistar-config.example` — Pi-Star / image config snippet
- `notes.md` — any build notes or wiring diagrams

Images for the site gallery should go in `public/hotspot/` (see below).

Image filenames (place these in `public/hotspot/`):

- `hotspot-1.jpg`
- `hotspot-2.jpg`
- `hotspot-3.jpg`

Once you add images under `public/hotspot/`, the Hotspot page will display them in the gallery. Update or add further files under this templates folder as you like.
